# Part V: Performance and Integration

> Placeholder for future content. This part will focus on performance tuning, diagnostics, and integrating ChESS into larger systems.

Planned sections:

- **5.1 Performance tuning**
  - When to enable `rayon` / `simd`.
  - Buffer reuse patterns (`PyramidBuffers`).
  - Benchmarking suggestions.
- **5.2 Tracing and diagnostics**
  - Enabling the `tracing` feature.
  - Using JSON traces from the CLI.
  - Interpreting spans and timings.
- **5.3 Integration patterns**
  - Camera calibration and pose estimation.
  - Real-time pipelines (video, robotics, AR).
  - Handling missing / partial boards and spurious corners.
