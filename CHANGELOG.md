# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- Pluggable subpixel refinement trait (`CornerRefiner`) with three built-ins: center-of-mass (legacy default), Förstner, and saddle-point quadratic fit, plus reusable runtime selector (`RefinerKind`).
- New public helpers to pick refiners explicitly (`find_corners_u8_with_kind`, `find_chess_corners_with_refiner`, `find_chess_corners_image_with_refiner`) and config field `ChessConfig::refiner`.
- Refinement docs and README guidance on choosing/configuring refiners; core README updated with refined examples.
- Unit tests covering each refiner and a regression test ensuring the default matches prior COM behavior.

### Changed

- Default behavior remains center-of-mass refinement, but the detector wiring now routes through the refiner abstraction; refinement window radius is driven by the selected refiner.

## [0.1.2]

### Added

- Test images in `./testimages`
- Examples are tested and documented
- `tools/README.md` describing the Python benchmarking and visualization helpers.
- Basic contributor guidance (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) for running tests, docs, and feature-matrix checks.

### Changed

- Default `ChessParams` and `CoarseToFineParams` are adjusted to work in most practical cases out of the box
- CLI config examples and documentation now use numeric `radius` / `descriptor_radius` fields; these are validated and mapped to the underlying ChESS ring radii while still allowing boolean overrides from CLI flags.
- Public detector helpers (`find_chess_corners_u8`, `find_chess_corners`, `find_chess_corners_image`) are now marked `#[must_use]` and document their preconditions.
- Crate metadata now points to the `chess-corners-rs` docs site and exposes search keywords on crates.io.
